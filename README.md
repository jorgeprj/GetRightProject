Get_Right Project is an e-sports team management simulation game (at first focused on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). The idea is for you to be able to create your own manager, assemble your line-up, strategy for each game and even work behind the scenes to transform your organization into the largest e-sports team in the world. Every decision you make directly affects your team's future.
